        projects in development, including Godavari River Basin Irrigation Projects and Nagarjuna Sagar Dam.Andhra

    <h1 id="id1">Aquaculture</h1>
    <p id="id2">Aquaculture such as cultivating fish, crustaceans, molluscs, Shrimp production etc., are the major
        occupations
        of coastal areas. Andhra Pradesh is the largest producer of shrimp in the country, with 70% of the production
        from the state itself.[14] The geographical location of the state allows marine fishing as well as inland fish
        production. Cyclones may do less damage to aquaculture than to crop production. Hence, farmers are getting
        attracted towards this industry. It grew from ₹3.46 billion (US$46 million) to ₹5.61 billion (US$75
        million). The Waterbase Limited is an aquaculture unit located at Nellore, it encourages scientific shrimp
        farming. Most exported marine exports include Vannamei shrimp.</p>
    <h1 id="id1">Horticulture</h1>
    <p id="id2">Andhra Pradesh has made significant contributions to India's traditional Horticulture crops cultivation.
        Increased area and production under Horticultural crops has put Andhra Pradesh in a stronger position in terms
        of attracting investments from private sector.

        Given that area and production of fruits and vegetables have been increasing steadily, Andhra Pradesh has the
        potential to increase its contribution towards the economy by way of exports There is a voluntary shift in the
        cropping pattern, as returns from Horticulture per unit of land are higher in comparison to Agriculture. The
        Horticulture is climate resilient, therefore assures higher income to farmers. Due to changing Socioeconomic
        profile and increasing middle class coupled with higher per capita income this sector has more potential as food
        habits are changing and people are becoming more health conscious.

        The State has 17.48 Lakhs Ha. Under Horticulture crops with an annual production of 301.73 Lakhs metric tons.
        Horticulture sector contributes approximately 16.07% to the state GVA.

        AREA and PRODUCTION:In Andhra Pradesh area under Horticulture crops is 17.48 lakhs Hectors with a production of
        301.73 lakh MTs. Andhra Pradesh stands at 1st position in Chillies, Cocoa, Lime, Oil Palm, Papaya and Tomato,
        2nd in Cashew, Mango and Sweet Orange in India. A.P. Ranks 1st in area and production of fruits and spices and
        2nd in Micro Irrigation area coverage</p>
    <h1 id="id1">Fisheries</h1>
    <p id="id2">Andhra Pradesh Fisheries contribute 10% of total fish and shrimp production of India. Accordingly, the
        government is focussed on developing this huge industry on a large scale. The convenient geographical location
        of this South Indian state allows marine fishing as well as inland fish production in Andhra Pradesh.The Value
        of marine products exports from India in 1998 was Rs. 4710 Crores among which the state alone contributed
        products of Rs. 2000 Crores.This data in itself explains the importance of fisheries in Andhra Pradesh.

        Andhra Pradesh constantly tries to increase fish seed production and stocking.For this they are using modern
        equipments like including the use of satellite data for forecasting movement of Fish shoals. Fishery Rights have
        been implemented and the government is trying to inspire the labourers to follow scientific fishing techniques
        that would be promote sustainable development and would be beneficial to all concerned. Issue of separate
        licenses for fisherman in inland waters and marine fishing crafts are in process.

        By 2020, Andhra Pradesh wishes to be a major exporter and provider of highly nutritious food. The central
        coastal districts of the state have been concentrating on advanced methods of fish production and the farmers
        are getting encouraged to convert agricultural lands into fresh water fishponds to obtain better yields and also
        to make full use of fresh water.

        Apart from fishing, Andhra Pradesh government is also inspiring to develop economically in other ways.
        Accordingly, the fisheries are developing as sites for recreation amidst the scenic beauty. Activities like boat
        riding in lakes and reservoirs, establishment of Angling clubs, ornamental fish and aquariums and construction
        of marine parks are upcoming for additional income.</p>
