    <h1 id="id1"> GENERALHISTORY</h1>
    <p id="id3"> Andhra Pradesh is one of the 28 states of India, whose recorded history begins in the Vedic period. It is
        mentioned in Sanskrit epics such as Aitareya Brahmana (800 BCE). The Assaka Mahajanapada (700–300 BCE)
        was an ancient kingdom located between the Godavari and Krishna Rivers in southeastern India</p>
    <h2 id="id1">OVERVIEWOFANDHRAPRADESH</h2>
    <p id="id3">In the sixth century BCE, Assaka was one of the sixteen mahajanapadas. It was succeeded by the Satavahana Dynasty
        (230 BCE-220 CE), who built the city of Amaravati. The kingdom reached its zenith under Gautamiputra Satakarni.
        At the end of the period, the Telugu region was divided into fiefdoms ruled by lords. In the late second century
        CE, the Andhra Ikshvakus ruled the eastern region along the Krishna River. During the fourth century, the
        Pallava dynasty extended their rule from southern Andhra Pradesh to Tamilakam and
        established their capital at Kanchipuram. Their power increased during the reigns of Mahendravarman I (571–630)
        and Narasimhavarman I (630–668). The Pallavas dominated the southern Telugu-speaking region and northern
        Tamilakam until the end of the ninth century. Between 1163 and 1323 the Kakatiya dynasty emerged, bringing the
        Telugu region under unified rule. During this
        period, the Telugu language emerged as a literary medium with the writings of Tikkana. In 1323 the sultan of
        Delhi, Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq, sent a large army commanded by Ulugh Khan (later, as
        Muhammad bin Tughluq, the Delhi sultan) to conquer the Telugu region and lay siege to Warangal. The fall of the
        Kakatiya Dynasty led to an era with competing influences from the Turkic kingdoms of Delhi, the Chalukya Chola
        dynasty (1070–1279) in the south and the Persio-Tajik sultanate of central India. The struggle for Andhra ended
        with the victory of the Musunuri Nayaks over the Turkic Delhi Sultanate.The Telugu achieved independence under
        Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara Empire (1336–1646). The Qutb Shahi
        Dynasty of the Bahmani Sultanate succeeded that empire. The Qutub Shahis were tolerant of Telugu culture from
        the early 16th to the end of the 17th centuries. The arrival of Europeans (the French under the Marquis de
        Bussy-Castelnau and the English under Robert Clive)
        altered polity of the region . In 1765, Clive and the chief and council at Visakhapatnam obtained the Northern
        Circars from Mughal emperor Shah Alam. The British achieved supremacy when they defeated Maharaja Vijaya Rama
        Gajapati Raju of Vizianagaram in 1792.</p>

    <h2 id="id2">CHALCOLITHIC PRRIOD</h2>
    <p id="id3">Chalcolithic period pottery dated between 1750 BC or earlier has been discovered from the sites near Krishna and
        Tungabhadra river such as Patapadu. A painted spouted vessel has resemblance to the chalcolithic age vessels
        from Navdatoli as far as Bronze age Crete</p>
    <h2 id="id1">PROTO HISTORY</h2>
    <p id="id3">The earliest reference to the term Andhra is the name of a tribe and this is made in the Aitareya Brahamana
        datable to 800 B.C. Andhras left the northern part of Indian subcontinent near Yamuna river, crossing the
        Vindhyas and came to present day Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It also mentions that the Andhras were socially
        parallel to other tribes like the Pundras, Sabarasand Pulindas. There are references to an Andhra kingdom and a
        people known as the Andhras in Indian epic poetry (the Mahabharata, the Ramayana and the Puranas). In the
        Mahabharata Rukmi ruled the Vidarbha Kingdom, which included the Deccan Plateau, the foothills of the Vindhya
        Range, present-day Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka and a little-known (now submerged)
        archipelago in the Bay of Bengal. Rama is said to have lived in the forest around present-day Bhadrachalam
        during his exile. Although the ancient literature indicates a history dating to several centuries BCE,
        archaeological evidence exists only from the last two millennia. The fifth-century BCE Kingdom of Pratipalapura,
        identified with Bhattiprolu in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, maybe the earliest kingdom in South India
        and inscriptions
        suggest that King Kubera ruled Bhattiprolu around 230 BCE. The script of the Bhattiprolu inscriptions was the
        progenitor of the Brahmi Lipi, which later diversified into modern Telugu scripts.</p>

    <h1 id="id1">Middle Kingdoms (3rd century BCE - 12th century CE)</h1>
    <h2 id="id2">SATHAVAHANA </h2>
    <p id="id3">As part of the Mauryan Empire during the fourth century BCE, Andhra was a political state in the southeastern
        Deccan. According to Megasthenes, who visited the court of Chandragupta Maurya (322-297), the Andhras had 30
        fortified towns along Godavari river and an army of 1,00,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 1,000 elephants. The
        military might of Andhras was second only to the Mauryas. Uninterrupted political and cultural accounts of
        Andhra Pradesh begin during the rise of the Satavahana dynasty.
        According to the Matsya Purana, the dynasty had 29 rulers in a 456-year period from the 2nd century BCE to the
        2nd century CE. An inscription at Nasik, written at the time of Gautamiputra Satakarni (the 23rd Satavahana
        ruler), indicates that the kingdom included most of the southern peninsula and southern parts of Maharashtra,
        Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. The court language used by the Satavahanas was Prakrit, and their kings observed the
        Vedic religion.The fall of the Satavahana empire left Andhra in political chaos, and local rulers carved out
        small kingdoms for
        themselves. Between 180 and 624 CE, control of Andhra lay with the Ikshvaku, Brihatpalayana, Salankayana,
        Vishnukundina, Vakataka, Pallava, Ananda Gotrika, Kalinga and other small kingdoms; the most important was the
        Ikshvaku. Sanskrit replaced Prakrit as the inscriptional language at this time.</p>
    <h2 id="id1">IKSHVAKUS</h2>
    <p id="id3">The Andhra Ikshvakus established a kingdom along the Krishna River in the second half of the second century CE.
        Their capital was Vijayapuri (Nagarjunakonda). Archaeological evidence indicates that the
        Ikshvakus succeeded the Satavahanas in the Krishna River valley, and may have entered Andhra from the north.[8]
        The Ikshvakus left inscriptions at Nagarjunakonda, Jaggayyapeta, Amaravati and Bhattiprolu, and their rulers
        observed the Vedic religion.It is a belief among some historians that, Andhra Ikshvakus were related to the
        mythological Ikshvakus, while
        some believe Andhra Ikshvakus seem to be a local tribe who adopted the title. Some scholars believe that
        this dynasty was related to the ancient Ikshvakus of the Hindu epics, and Rama of the Ramayana (the incarnation
        of Vishnu) was descended from the Ikshvaku line. Inscriptions in the Nagarjunakonda valley, Jaggayyapeta and
        Ramireddipalli provide some support for this hypothesis.In the Vayu Purana, Manu (the patriarch of ancient
        India) had nine sons; Ikshvaku, the eldest, founded the
        Suryavanshi dynasty and ruled from Ayodhya at the beginning of the Treta Yuga. He had 100 sons; the eldest was
        Vikushi, who succeeded his father as the ruler of Ayodhya. Fifty of Vikushi's brothers founded small
        principalities in North India, and forty-eight founded kingdoms in the south. In the Dharmamrita, during the
        lifetime of the 12th tirthankara, Yasodhara (an Ikshvaku prince from the kingdom of Anga) went to Vengi. The
        prince was so impressed with the region's beauty and fertility that he made it his home and founded the city of
        Pratipalapura (present-day Bhattiprolu). In the Puranas, the Andhra Ikshvakus are called Sriparvatiyas (rulers
        of Sriparvata) and Andhrabhrityas
        (servants of the Andhras). They were feudal lords of the Satavahanas, and bore the title of Mahatalavara.
        Although the Puranas cite seven kings ruling Andhra for 100 years, only four are confirmed in inscriptions.</p>
    <h1 id="id1"> AFTER 1947</h1>
    <h2 id="id2">after1947</h2>
    <p id="id3">In 1947, India gained independence from the United Kingdom. Although the Muslim Nizam of Hyderabad resisted, he
        was forced to cede his state to India in 1948 to form Hyderabad State. When India became independent,
        Telugu-speaking people (Urdu is spoken in some parts of Hyderabad and a few other districts of Hyderabad State)
        were distributed in 22 districts: nine in Hyderabad State, 12 in the Madras Presidency and one in
        French-controlled Yanam. In 1953 Andhra State was created from part of the Madras Presidency, the first state in
        India formed on a linguistic basis. In 1956, Andhra State was merged with the Telugu-speaking area of Hyderabad
        State to form the state of Andhra Pradesh.</p>
    <h2 id="id2">Madras Manade movement</h2>
    <p id="id3">Madras possessed Tamil and Telugu cultures. In the early 1920s, Madras Presidency Chief Minister Panagal Raja
        said that the Cooum River should be the boundary between the Andhra and Tamil regions. In 1953 Telugu speakers
        in the former Madras Presidency sought to make Madras the capital of Andhra Pradesh, adopting the slogan Madras
        manade ("Madras is ours"). However the city of Madras had 65 percentage of tamil speakers as opposed to 27
        percent telugu speakers that time and Madras stayed with the tamil state.</p>
    <h2 id="id2">Creation of Andhra State</h2>
    <p id="id3">Activist Potti Sriramulu advocated inclusion of the Telugu-speaking areas of Rayalaseema and Coastal Andhra in an
        Andhra state. He conducted a hunger strike until Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru promised to form an Andhra
        state. On 19 October 1952, when Nehru's promise had not been fulfilled, Sriramulu began fasting again at
        Maharshi Bulusu Sambamurthy's Madras home. The Andhra Congress committee disapproved of Sriramulu's hunger
        strike, but his action became widely known. He died shortly after midnight on 15 December 1952 at 126 Royapettah
        High Road, Mylapore, Madras, and the house has been preserved. During Sriramulu's funeral procession, mourners
        praised his sacrifice. When the procession reached Mount Road,
        thousands of people joined it and raised banners hailing Sriramulu. Later, they began destroying public
        property. The news spread quickly, and seven people were killed by police gunfire in Anakapalle and Vijayawada.
        The unrest continued for several days. On 19 December 1952, Prime Minister Nehru announced the formation of a
        separate state for the Telugu-speaking
        people of the Madras Presidency. On 1 October 1953, eleven districts in the Telugu-speaking portion of Madras
        State (Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema) voted to become Andhra State, with Kurnool as their capital. Andhra
        Kesari Tanguturi Prakasam Pantulu became chief minister of the new Telugu state</p>
    <h2 id="id2">Merger of Hyderabad and Andhra States</h2>
    <p id="id3">In December 1953, the States Reorganisation Commission convened to prepare for the creation of states along
        linguistic lines. Due to public demand, the commission recommended abolishing Hyderabad State and merging
        its Marathi-speaking region into Bombay State and its Kannada-speaking region into Mysore State.The States
        Reorganisation Commission (SRC) discussed a merger of the Telugu-speaking Telangana region of
        Hyderabad State and Andhra State. According to Paragraph 374 of the report, "The creation of Vishalandhra is an
        ideal to which numerous individuals and public bodies, both in Andhra and Telangana, have been passionately
        attached over a long period of time, and unless there are strong reasons to the contrary, this sentiment is
        entitled to consideration". About Telangana, paragraph 378 reads: "One of the principal causes of opposition of
        Vishalandhra also seems to be the apprehension felt by the educationally backward people of Telangana that they
        may be swamped and exploited by the more advanced people of the coastal areas". In its analysis, the SRC opposed
        an immediate merger. Paragraph 386 reads, "After taking all these factors into consideration we have come to the
        conclusion that it will be in the interests of Andhra as well as Telangana, if for the present, the Telangana
        area is to constitute into a separate State, which may be known as the Hyderabad State with provision for its
        unification with Andhra after the general elections likely to be held in or about 1961 if by a two thirds
        majority the legislature of the residuary Hyderabad State expresses itself in favor of such unification". The
        central government, led by Nehru, merged Andhra State and Telangana to form Andhra Pradesh on 1 November 1956
        after ensuring safeguards to Telangana in the form of a gentleman's agreement.</p>
    <h2 id="id2">Telangana movement</h2>
    <p id="id3">1972 and 2009. On 9 December 2009, the Government of India announced the formation of a Telangana state. Protests
        in the Coastal Andhra and Rayalseema regions took place immediately after the announcement, and on 23 December
        2009 the decision was indefinitely deferred. The Telangana movement for statehood continued, with suicides,
        strikes and protests</p>
    <h2 id="id2">Bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh</h2>
    <p id="id3">On 30 July 2013, the Congress Working Committee unanimously approved a resolution recommending the formation of a
        Telangana state. In February 2014, a bill was placed before Parliament. The Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation
        Act, 2014 was passed, allowing the formation of a Telangana state of ten districts from north-western Andhra
        Pradesh. The bill received the assent of the president, and was published in The Gazette of India on 1
        March. The state of Telangana was officially formed on 2 June 2014.
