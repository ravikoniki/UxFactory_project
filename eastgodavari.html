    It is at a distance of about 15 Km from Kakinada on Kakinada Yanam Road. Coringa Sanctuary, named after
        a tiny village coringa in East Godavari District of Andhra Pradesh a part of Godavari Mangroves was declared as
        a wildlife sanctuary by Govt. of Andhra Pradesh vide G.O.Ms.No – 484, Forests and Rural Development (For.III)
        Department dated 5-7-1978 was to conserve the mangrove vegetation of the estuary, extending in an area of about
        235.Sq.Kms. It is located between 16o-30′ to 17o-00′ N latitudes and 82o-14′ to 82o-23’E longitudes. Mangroves
        are salt – tolerent forest ecosystems of tropical and sub – tropical intertidal regions of the world. They
        normally occur between high waterlevel and near about mean sea level along the sheltered shores, estuaries,
        tidal creeks, back-waters, lagoons, marshes and mud-flats.Where conditions favour the Mangroves may form
        extensive and productive forests in the sheltered coastal lines.
        The mangrovees contain a highly specialised community of plants associated with animal species which are not
        capable of surviving in any other situations. Mangrove occur in Andhra Pradesh in estuaries of Krishna and
        Godavari rivers. Andhra Pradesh has got an area of 582 Sq.KM.of Mangrove forests, accounting for about 9% of
        local forest area of the State, which amounts to just about 2% of the local geographical area of the State. Even
        the entire land under mangroves do not contain fully the Mangrove vegetation. The area includes forest of open
        blanks. Sandy patches and Mud-flats.</p>
