    <h1 id="id1">Vizianagaram Fort</h1>
    <p id="id2"><img src="vizayanagaram/vizayanagaramfort.jfif" width="20%">
    Vijayarama Raju-I laid the foundation of Vizianagaram fort in 1713 A.D. on the auspicious day of Vijaya
        Dashmi. The Victory arch was the main entrance to the Vizianagaram fort prior to the construction of Nagaar
        Khana. It has a temple of Lord Hanuman on one side and Goddess Lakshmi on the other. The Goddess is also known
        as ‘Kota Shakti’ or the guardian of the fort. The Raja of Vizianagaram would seek blessings of the Goddess
        before embarking on any military expedition. The main entrance to the fort is through the East Gate. Nagaar
        Khana is situated atop this gate. ‘Nagaara’ is an Indian percussion instrument. A literal translation of ‘Nagaar
        Khana’ would mean ‘Drum Room’. It was used for drawing attention of the people for announcing royal edicts. The
        drummer also used the Nagaara to announce and alert the inmates to the arrival of royal guests. The West Gate is
        the rear entrance to the Vizianagaram fort. This gateway is built in Rajasthani style and has a viewing pavilion
        on top. It connects the fort to the Pedda Cheruvu and to the royal tombs. As per Hindu customs and traditions,
        the deceased should be taken for cremation only from the rear door of the household. The West Gate with the
        royal tombs close by served this purpose. The fort was surrounded by a moat. The area between the west wall and
        the moat has been converted into a splendid park with well laid out gardens and lush green lawns by the present
        day administration</p>

    During the British Raj, the Kings of Vizianagaram made frequent visits to London. The Big Ben in London
        inspired them to make a replica in the town. The Ghanta Stambham (Clock Tower) originally had a sandstone finish
        with a white top and has now been painted cream and red. This 68 feet high octagonal building was built at a
        cost of only Rs.5,400. in 1885 and is located very close to the fort, right in the heart of the city.During the British Raj, the Kings of Vizianagaram made frequent visits to London. The Big Ben in London

        echoes memories of a grand past wherein a resplendent king assisted by richly dressed courtiers held court and
        administered the kingdom in their collective wisdom and goodwill. The main door is decorated with two exquisite
        marble statues which speak of the good taste as well as the wealth of the occupants. The Moti Mahal is the main
        and most prominent building in the Vizianagaram fort. It was donated to the MANSAS Trust by Dr. P.V.G Raju.
        Today, it serves the noble purpose of furthering education by housing a college meant exclusively for women on
        the first floor. The link with its past is maintained through a display of artifacts in a museum on the ground
