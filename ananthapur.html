    <p id="id2"><img src="ananthapur/4.webp" width="20%">
    The Gooty fort is one of the oldest hill forts in Andhra Pradesh. This historical marvel is perched 300
        meters above the Gooty plains. The fort was built by the rulers of the Vijayanagara Kingdom but eventually fell
        into the hands of the Marathas. It was occupied by Haider Ali in 1773 and later fell to the British after the
        defeat of Tipu Sultan in 1799.

        What makes this fort unique is its shell-like structure that contains 15 forts and 15 main doors. The compounds
        of the fort comprise a series of walls linked by 14 gates. The fort also features two edifices, one of which is
        a gymnasium while the other is a powder magazine. Another special feature of the fort is the availability of
        water in a structure located at such an incredible height. Some of the inscriptions on the walls of this fort go
        back to the 7th century.

        Inside the fort also stands a small pavilion built of polished limestone called Murari Rao’s seat. Truly a seat
        with a view, it is located on the edge of a cliff offering stunning views of the valley below. Gooty is located
        at a distance of 52 km from Anantapur on the Kurnool-Bangalore trunk road. Bookmark this fort and put it on top

    nown as ‘Ghangari’ in local inscriptions, the Penukonda Fort was a strategic capital of the
        Vijayanagara empire for a short duration. The fort’s defenses were impeccable and never saw defeat! It is one of
        the best places to visit in Anantapur – with smaller palaces, temples, and other fascinating structures housed
        within the complex.

        The fort comprises of two particularly fascinating sites. The first is the Gagan Mahal which was used as a
        summer resort by the Vijayanagar Emperors. The Gagan Mahal was built in 1575 AD and served as the center of
        opulence, reserved exclusively for royalty during the period. The second integral site housed within the fort
        complex is the Babayya Darga – a structure symbolizing communal harmony between Hindus and Muslims.

        Penukonda is located at a distance of 50 km from Anantapur on the NH7 highway to Bangalore.</p>

        was built at a height of 2727 ft above sea level. Its numerous forts within a fort were built deliberately to
        keep enemies at bay and were hugely successful at doing so. The fort exudes an aura of grandeur even though most
        of it is now crumbling and in ruins. The views from the top of the fort are spectacular!

        Numerous temples and shrines are located within the fort complex. Some of the more prominent of which are the
        ones dedicated to Narashimhaswamy, Hanuman, Jambukeswara, Prasanna, Venkateswara Kanyakaparameswari, and Elamma.

    <h1 id="id1">Anantasagaram</h1>
    <p id="id2">Anantasagaram is a reservoir so integral that the city of Anantapur was named after it. It is one of the
        biggest reservoirs in the district spread across a sprawling area of 2,511 acres in Anantapur and
        Bukkarayasamudram. According to folklore, a woman named Musalamma sacrificed herself in the waters of
        Anantasagaram to stop a breach forming in the tank. A portion of the tank was then called ‘Musalammakatta’ as a
        tribute to her bravery and sacrifice. The crystal waters of the reservoir are immensely soothing to the eyes. It
        is a great spot for a short break from the trials of everyday routine</p>
    <h1 id="id1">Anantapur Clock Tower</h1>
    <p id="id2">In every city lies a structure central to its identity and history. The iconic Clock Tower is one such
        landmark in the city of Anantapur. It was built in memory of the people who sacrificed their lives during the
        struggle for India’s Independence. The Clock Tower contains eight faces to signify the eighth month in the year
        – August. Additionally, the clock’s radius is 15 ft to commemorate 15th August, India’s Independence Day. This
        beautiful tower stands tall even today and is especially resplendent when lit up at night.</p>
