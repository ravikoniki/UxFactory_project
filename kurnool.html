    <p>Kurnool, an ancient city that has existed for over 2,000 years has derived its name from the word ‘Kandanavolu’
        which means the ‘Town of Grease’. It is believed that during the 11th century, stones were transported in carts
        to Alampur, and Kurnool served as a prominent halt as the locals supplied grease for the carts. According to
        historians, the entire region of Kurnool was established by a Pathan general and ruled by Nawabs. Kurnool also
        served as the capital of Andhra Pradesh for nearly 3 years (1st October 1953 to 1st November 1956).

        The place is home to numerous attractions that attract travelers and history lovers from across the world. You
