    <h1 id="id1">Sree kottasathemma goddess, nidadavolu zone</h1>
    <p id="id2"><img src="westgodavari/3.jpg" width="20%">
   In the 13th Century, King Veerabhadra Chalukya, spouse of Rani Rudrama Devi, ruled a part of West
        Godavari District, with Niravadyapuram(Nidadavolu) as a Capital. During his rule Nidadavolu was designed as Fort
        and took place several wars. It is believed that the fort was protected by goddess kotasattemma. Niravadyapuram
        became famous during kakateeya dynasty.
        Reddi dynasty succeeded after the decline of kakateeya dynasty. Floods and natural calamities swept away the
        temple and the statue of Ammavaru, which immersed in nature and remained unknown for several centuries. In 1934,
        a local farmer Sri Devulapalli Ramamurthy Sastry was plunging his land and accidently the plunging weapon hit on
        the statue of Ammavaru. The Goddess appeared in his dream and asked him to contrust a temple for her.Sri Sastry
        with help of other farmers contructed the temple and it was surrounded by compound walls. The Temple was
        administered by Yadavas. The temple of Sri Kota Sattemma Ammavari became very famous in a short period of a time
        and people developed more faith as they felt that their wishes are fulfilled by worshipping the goddess.</p>
