    <img src="guntur/6.jpg" width="20%">
    <p id="id2">The great Buddhist Stupa is at Amaravathi. A king had planned to build a new capital in the year 1796 at
        a place called Amareswaram. While the place was being excavated, the workers saw some bricks and saw some stone
        pieces with the carvings. These were some of the remnants of the old stupa. Later on the surface was developed
        by engraved marble slabs, limestone slabs. The gateways and the fences also had many inscriptions on them.</p>
